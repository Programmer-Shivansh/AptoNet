## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Programmer-Shivansh/AptoNet.git
    cd AptoNet
    ```

2. **Setup Blockchain**

    ```bash
    cd scripts
    aptos init 
    // Put the address obtained in the setup_blockchain.sh
    ./setup_blockchain.sh
    ```
    - Save the VPort Admin Address

3. **Deploy Smart Contracts**

    ```bash
    cd aptos/contracts

    cd mac_table 
    aptos init 
    // Put the address obtained in move.toml
    cd ../vport_management
    aptos init
    // Put the address obtained in move.toml

    cd ../scripts
    ./deploy_contracts.sh
    ```

    - This will compile and publish the VPort Management and MAC Table contracts to the Aptos blockchain.

4. **Configure and Run VSwitch Server**

    ```bash
    cd ../vswitch
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python3 src/vswitch.py <SERVER_PORT>
    ```

    - Replace `<SERVER_PORT>` with your desired port number (e.g., `8000`).

5. **Build and Run VPort Clients**

    ```bash
    cd ../../vport
    make
    sudo ./vport <SERVER_IP> <SERVER_PORT>
    ```

    - Replace `<SERVER_IP>` with the VSwitch server's IP address and `<SERVER_PORT>` with the port number.

6. **Configure UTUN Devices**

    On each client machine:

    ```bash
    sudo ifconfig utun4 10.1.1.101 10.1.1.102 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
    sudo ifconfig utun5 10.1.1.102 10.1.1.101 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
    ```
    - Adjust the IP address as needed for each client.

7. **Test Connectivity**

    - Ping between clients to ensure connectivity:

    ```bash
    ping 10.1.1.102  # From Client-1 to Client-2
    ping 10.1.1.101  # From Client-2 to Client-1
    ```


## How It Works

1. **VPort Registration and Authentication**

    - VPorts register with the VSwitch server via the Aptos blockchain.
    - Smart contracts handle authentication, ensuring only authorized VPorts can connect.

2. **Decentralized MAC Address Management**

    - The MAC address table is stored on the Aptos blockchain.
    - VSwitch nodes read from and write to the blockchain to maintain a consistent view of the network.

3. **Ethernet Frame Forwarding**

    - VSwitch nodes manage Ethernet frame exchanges based on the decentralized MAC table.
    - Frames are forwarded to the appropriate VPort clients or broadcasted as needed.
